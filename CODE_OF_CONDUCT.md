# Code of Conduct

## TL;DR

Don't be a dick!

## What we stand for

CFLint is a project developed and worked on by volunteers. Please be nice and considerate -- we're here to help. We really appreciate fixes and improvements, so feel free to talk to us and/or provide pull requests.

This is a place where considerate positive people, who enjoy fun and care about their craft and its impact, come together to code, learn, talk, hang out and build a product for the greater good of the CFML community.

We're inclusive and harassment-free based on treating everyone with respect and kindness, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, physical ability or appearance, ethnicity or religious beliefs.

We try to do everything we can to ensure that only the good stuff happens. If somebody violates that, or makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe in any way, please let us know. We'll take it seriously and their behaviour will be dealt with as deemed necessary. They'll certainly be asked to stop the inappropriate behaviour and will be expected to comply immediately. It may also include ejection from the project.

We respect all participants, and assume everyone joins in good faith. We won't attempt to list all the behaviours that are unacceptable and inappropriate when you are interacting with your peers, in case we inadvertently exclude the one very thing leads to an incident. To quote the folks from the Kiwicon conference, the “inventive genius of random assholes” is limitless. It surely goes without saying however, that offensive comments, intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of discussions and unwelcome sexual attention are totally inappropriate.

If you have any concerns whatsoever, about the comfort and safety of yourself or someone else, please contact [Ryan](https://github.com/ryaneberly) or [Kai](https://github.com/TheRealAgentK) at any time.
