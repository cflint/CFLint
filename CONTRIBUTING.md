# Contributing to CFLint

## Project and library organisation

CFLint is a project developed and worked on by volunteers. When logging issues please be nice and considerate -- we're here to help. We really appreciate fixes and improvements, so feel free to talk to us and/or provide pull requests.

`/src/main` contains the source code. Tests can be found in `/src/test`. CFLint relies heavily on the [CFParser](https://github.com/cfparser/cfparser) project as well as a bunch of 3rd party Java libraries.

The `master` branch is considered our stable codebase. Most of the development happens in the `dev` branch resp. local development branches for specific issues.

## How to contribute?

The main repository of this project is <https://github.com/cflint/CFLint>.

Please fork from there, create a local dev branch from `origin/dev` (named so that it explains the work in the branch), and submit a pull request against the main repository's `dev` branch. Even better, get in touch with us here on GitHub before you undertake any work so that it can be coordinated with what we're doing.

If you're interested in contributing on a regular basis, get in touch with [Ryan](https://github.com/ryaneberly) and we can add you to the internal CFLint Slack team.
