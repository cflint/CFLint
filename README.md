# Versions

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for further information.

# Project and library organisation

CFLint is a project developed and worked on by volunteers. When logging issues please be nice and considerate, we're here to help. We really appreciate fixes and improvements, feel free to talk to us and/or provide pull requests.

/src/main contains the source code. Tests can be found in /src/test. CFLint relies heavily on the [CFParser](https://github.com/cfparser/cfparser) project as well as a bunch of 3rd party Java libraries.

The master branch is considered our stable codebase. Most of the development happens in the dev branch resp. local development branches for specific issues.
 
# Building CFLint

1. Fork the repository into your account and clone or download the codebase as a zip-file.
2. Install the tooling of your choice and build via Gradle or Maven (deprecated). CFlint requires Java 8.

    a. Gradle: execute
        
        gradlew build
        
    in the cflint directory

    b. Maven: execute
    
        mvn clean install
        
    in the cflint directory
    
    Alternatively import the CFLint codebase into the IDE of your choice and use its respectively Gradle/Maven integration. This should work out of the box for Eclipse and IntelliJ users.
    
# Using CFLint - Quickstart

Get the latest version from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ccflint) or the [CFLint Github release page](https://github.com/cflint/CFLint/releases) or build the project.

If you want to use CFLint from within another Maven project, use:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.cflint</groupId>
        <artifactId>CFLint</artifactId>
        <version>1.2.0</version>
    </dependency>

Or always use the latest:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.cflint</groupId>
        <artifactId>CFLint</artifactId>
        <version>LATEST</version>
    </dependency>
    
With the binaries retrieved one or the other way, you can now use CFLint on the command line.

#### Use the "-all"-version of the jar-file: 

    CFLint-1.2.0-all.jar

#### Scan a folder with the complete set of rules:

    java -jar CFLint-1.2.0-all.jar -folder <baseFolder>

#### Scan a folder with the complete set of rules:
    
    java -jar CFLint-1.2.0-all.jar -file <fullPathToFile>
        
#### See parameters and help:

    java -jar CFLint-1.2.0-all.jar -help

# User manual

**Note: This is a work in progress, we're currently collating information from a variety of sources.**

## Introduction

The most simple options for executing CFLint is via the command line. CFLint currently has a UI mode (triggered by -ui on the command line) which will be removed by the latest for CFLint 2.0 - see [issue 316](https://github.com/cflint/CFLint/issues/316). If you rely on the UI mode, you're unfortunately on your own - no more work will go into this from here onwards.

## Configuration

Alternatively to the commannd line you can supply a global configuration via the -configfile switch or put .cflintrc files into certain directories. Configuring CFLint this way conceptually allows you to run specific rules in specific parts of your application.

CFlint currently supports XML- and JSON-based configuration. XML-based configuration will be deprecated in CFLint 1.3.0 and removed in CFLint 2.0.

### Rules

When CFLint executes, it scans and parses your code (using CFParser). The syntax tree is then being examined against a set of built-in rules. In CFLint those rules are called and implemented as plugins (they live in /src/main/java/com/cflint/plugins). By default all rules will be used against your codebase. This is what a lot of people will do, but using configuration allows you to build a custom scenario to test your code against. See RULES.md for more information on rules and their meaning.

### Global configuration

The -configfile options can be used to replace the standard global configuration file.

The standard configuration is src/main/resources/cflint.definition.json. Common usage of CFLint usually does not require replacing this file.

### Folder-based configuration

Putting a .cflintrc file into a directory allows you to specify certain rules that should be executed for this directory and its children. Additionally you can specify a handful of other properties.

An example .cflintrc file is shown below:
 
     {
       "output" : [ ],
       "rule" : [ ],
       "excludes" : [ ],
       "includes" : [ {
         "code" : "FUNCTION_HINT_MISSING"
       } ],
       "inheritParent" : false,
       "inheritPlugins" : true
     }

- rule allows you add a plugin for this folder that is not listed in the global configuration.  See ruleImpl in cflint.definition.json for examples.  

- excludes and includes allow you to specify an array of objects describing rules you want to be applied for this directory and its children. In the example above, the only rule to be checked for will be FUNCTION_HINT_MISSING.

- inheritParent configures if the rules set in the global or any parent configuration should be inherited as a base set of rules. 

- Please note: inheritPlugins and output have been marked deprecated in CFLint 1.2.0 and will be removed in 1.3.0. If you are using .cflintrc files now, please remove the inheritPlugins and output properties as soon as possible. Plugin inheritance will going forward always be treated as true, the team can not see a use case in which it should be disabled. The value of the output attribute is ignored.

### Annotation-based configuration

Quite often there are scenarios in which you would generally want to run a certain set of rules against your code but in specific cases need to ignore an otherwise valid violation.

A common example are violations of CFQUERYPARAM_REQ that can't be fixed by applying <CFQUERYPARAM...> because your DB server doesn't allow <CFQUERPARAM> in a certain position (for instance in a SELECT TOP #arguments.numberOfRecords# ... scenario). See [#282](https://github.com/cflint/CFLint/issues/282) for more examples.

CFLint offers an annotation-based configuration to deal with this and similar scenarios. Annotations can be placed on the component- or function-level in a CFC or inline with code.

#### Tag-based CFML:

	<!---
	@CFLintIgnore SOMETHINGELSE,MISSING_VAR,ANOTHERTHINGTOIGNORE
	--->

#### CFSCRIPT:

Ignoring all rules on the current line:

    //cflint ignore:line
    
Ignoring a specific rule (or a comma-separated list of rules) on the current line:
    
    //cflint ignore:MISSING_VAR
    
Multiline ignore annotation:

    /*
        @CFLintIgnore SOMETHINGELSE,MISSING_VAR,ANOTHERTHINGTOIGNORE
    */
#### Ignoring within SQL:

Within SQL, you can also use

    <!--- @CFLintIgnore CFQUERYPARAM_REQ --->
    
to ignore a rule violation on the next line.

### Precendence of configuration settings

Configuration of which plugins are run and which rules are included starts with the global configuration and flows through the command line parameters, folder level rules, and down to the annotations within the source.

- global configuration
- custom configuration file  (--configfile)
- rule groups (--rulegroups,  default behaviour is --rulegroups !Experimental)
- includes/excludes from the command line (--includeRule and --excludeRule)
- .cflintrc - folder level configuration, mostly for including/excluding specific messages
- annotations - explicitly exclude messages in the source code at the tag or line level.

The configuration rule that is closest to the rule is the one that takes effect.
* If an annotation excludes a message, it will not fire regardless of any configuration above it.
* If you exclude a rule at the command line level, but a .cflintrc adds it back in, it will fire for source files in that part of the source tree.

## Creating reports

CFLint supports a variety of output options that you can control via command-line flags. If youy want more information about the inner workings of CFLint during execution you can run CFLint in verbose mode by supplying -verbose or -v at the command line.

### XML

The flag -xml instructs CFLint to create XML. There are two options for XML reporting. 

The first option is what we call CFlint XML. It's an internal format that adheres to a basic schema. You could then use this format as-is or to do further processing of your choice. 

The seconds option is Findbugs XML. The resulting XML document adheres to the current version of the Findbugs Bugcollection XML Schema Definition (src/main/resources/findbugs/bugcollection.xsd) and can be used in most CI-/Build-Server products. Jetbrains Team City 10+ can import this format out of the box.

Please note: Currently it's not possible to produce BOTH flavours of XML reports at the same time. This is a known limitation. If you feel this hinders your use of CFLint, please raise an issue.

#### CFLint XML

To create CFLint XML provide the following command-line arguments:

    -xml -xmlstyle cflint -xmlfile <outputFileName>
    
Example of CFLint XML:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
    <issues version="1.2.0" timestamp="1500107134">
      <issue severity="WARNING" id="CFQUERYPARAM_REQ" message="CFQUERYPARAM_REQ" category="CFLint" abbrev="CR">
        <location file="/Users/kai/Documents/Code/paypal.cfc" fileName="paypal.cfc" function="doSomething" column="0" line="325" message="&lt;cfquery&gt; should use &lt;cfqueryparam/&gt; for variable 'arguments.PaymentType'." variable="arguments.PaymentType">
          <Expression><![CDATA[<cfquery name="doPayment" datasource="#paymentDatasource#">...some more Details...]]></Expression>
        </location>
      </issue>
      <issue severity="WARNING" id="CFQUERYPARAM_REQ" message="CFQUERYPARAM_REQ" category="CFLint" abbrev="CR">
        <location file="/Users/kai/Documents/Code/paypal.cfc" fileName="paypal.cfc" function="doSomethingElse" column="0" line="432" message="&lt;cfquery&gt; should use &lt;cfqueryparam/&gt; for variable 'arguments.something'." variable="arguments.something">
          <Expression><![CDATA[<cfquery name="doPayment" datasource="#paymentDatasource#">...some more Details...]]></Expression>
        </location>
      </issue>
    ...
      <counts totallines="108" totalsize="55596">
        <count code="CFQUERYPARAM_REQ" count="39"></count>
        <count severity="WARNING" count="39"></count>
      </counts>
    </issues>

#### Findbugs XML

To create Findbugs XML provide the following command-line arguments:

    -xml -xmlstyle findbugs -xmlfile <outputFileName>
    
The Findbugs XML format is currently created using an XSLT document, transforming the CFLint report to Findbugs XML (src/main/resources/findbugs/cflint-to-findbugs.xsl).

### JSON

JSON output can be created with

    -json -jsonfile <outputFileName>

Example of CFLint JSON:

    {
      "version" : "",
      "timestamp" : "1501202128",
      "issues" : [ {
        "severity" : "ERROR",
        "id" : "MISSING_VAR",
        "message" : "MISSING_VAR",
        "category" : "CFLINT",
        "abbrev" : "MV",
        "locations" : [ {
          "file" : "src/test/resources/com/cflint/tests/Ignores/ignoreCFMLAny2.cfc",
          "fileName" : "ignoreCFMLAny2.cfc",
          "function" : "testFunction",
          "column" : 6,
          "line" : 14,
          "message" : "Variable someVar is not declared with a var statement.",
          "variable" : "someVar",
          "expression" : "someVar"
        } ]
      } ],
      "counts" : {
        "totalFiles" : 7,
        "totalLines" : 49,
        "countByCode" : [ {
          "code" : "MISSING_VAR",
          "count" : 1
        } ],
        "countBySeverity" : [ {
          "severity" : "ERROR",
          "count" : 1
        } ]
      }
    }

### Text

Plain text output can be created with

    -text -textfile <outputFileName>
    
Example of plain text output:

    Issue
    Severity:WARNING
    Message code:CFQUERYPARAM_REQ
        File:/Users/kai/Documents/Code/paypal.cfc
        Column:0

## Integration server support

For Jenkins, please look at the Jenkins/Hudson plugin mentioned further below. 

Jetbrains' TeamCity has support for Findbugs XML code inspection reports. They can be produced out of the box with CFLint from 1.2.0 onwards (see above in the Findbugs XML section).

There is support for SonarQube through Stepstone's Sonar ColdFusion plugin mentioned further below.

There's an NPM wrapper for CLint below. Please be aware that the wrapper seems to come with its own bundled CFLint binary which might not be up to date, which is outside of our control.

Other products in the integeration/build server category might work, too. If you're using a specific product that works for you with CFLint please let us know. If you can't get CFLint to work in an environment you use, please let us know as well - we might be able to help.

## IDE support

Currently there is IDE support for Sublime through a 3rd-party project (see below). 

There is also support for Adobe's CFBuilder through a 3rd-party project (see below). Users of CFBuilder, please also see the discussion in issue [#327](https://github.com/cflint/CFLint/issues/327).

Users of Atom can integrate with AtomLinter through a 3rd-party project (see below).

Support for Jetbrains' IntelliJ is planned; talk to [@TheRealAgentK](https://github.com/TheRealAgentK) for more info if you're interested.

## Extending CFLint

### Adding custom rules

    package com.cflint.plugins.core;

    import net.htmlparser.jericho.Element;
    import cfml.parsing.cfscript.script.CFFuncDeclStatement;
    import cfml.parsing.cfscript.script.CFFunctionParameter;
    import cfml.parsing.cfscript.script.CFScriptStatement;
      
    import com.cflint.BugList;
    import com.cflint.plugins.CFLintScannerAdapter;
    import com.cflint.plugins.Context;
    import com.cflint.tools.CFTool;
     
    public class ArgDefChecker extends CFLintScannerAdapter {
     
        @Override
        public void expression(final CFScriptStatement expression, final Context context, final BugList bugs) {
            if (expression instanceof CFFuncDeclStatement) {
                final CFFuncDeclStatement function = (CFFuncDeclStatement) expression;
                for (final CFFunctionParameter argument : function.getFormals()) {
                    // handler.addArgument(param.getName());
                    final String name = argument.getName();
                    if (!argument.toString().contains("required") && !argument.toString().contains("=")) {
                        function.getLine();
                        function.getColumn();
                        context.addMessage("ARG_DEFAULT_MISSING", name);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
     
        @Override
        public void element(final Element element, final Context context, final BugList bugs) {
            if (element.getName().equals("cfargument")) {
                final String name = element.getAttributeValue("name");
                final boolean required = CFTool.toBoolean(element.getAttributeValue("required"));
                final String defaultExpr = element.getAttributeValue("default");
                if (!required && defaultExpr == null) {
                    element.getSource().getRow(element.getBegin());
                    element.getSource().getColumn(element.getBegin());
                    context.addMessage("ARG_DEFAULT_MISSING", name);
                }
            }
        }
    }

Looking at the function `element`, the arguments are:
* element - the current CFML tag
* context - the current file being checked
* bugs - the appending object of violations

# Receipes

## Ignoring a directory for processing

The easiest way to achieve this is with a custom .cflintrc file:

The includes field is ignored if it is an empty list, so simply add a single item to it for which nothing matches.

    {
        "code" : "NOTHING"
    }

or simply:

    {}


The following will ignore all rules in the current folder and below.

    {
      "output" : [ ],
      "rule" : [ ],
      "excludes" : [ ],
      "includes" : [ {}],
      "inheritParent" : false,
      "inheritPlugins" : true
    }


This can be simplified using the default values of a .cflintrc file:

    {
      "includes" : [{}],
      "inheritParent" : false
    }

See the discussion in [#290](https://github.com/cflint/CFLint/issues/290) for more info.


## Filtering out specific processing results in specific folders

Supply a cflintexclude.json file in ???  
---TO DO START  
Where would such a file go?  
---TO DO END  

#### Example

To filter out the GLOBAL_VAR messages in the "some\package\location\" folder, add the following to cflintexclude.json</p>

**Windows**

    [
        other exclude rules...,
        {"file":".*some\\\\package\\\\location\\\\.*","code":"GLOBAL_VAR"}
    ]

Note: The back slashes must be escaped twice, once for JSON, once for regular expressions

**\*nix**

    [
        other exclude rules...,
        {"file":".*some/package/location/.*","code":"GLOBAL_VAR"}
    ]
